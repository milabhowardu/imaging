    biography: `
      Dr. Chao-Hsiung Hsu is a Post-doctoral fellow at the Molecular Imaging Laboratory at the Department of Radiology of Howard University. Dr. Hsu completed his B.S. and M.S. in chemistry at National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. He received his PhD degree in chemistry from the National Tsing-Hua University in conjunction with the Molecular Science and Technology Program, Taiwan International Graduate Program, Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. His research interests include studying the brain metabolism by using the method of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CEST-MRI) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy; developing new MR pulse sequence for tumor early detection and molecular image and optimizing the heating process of magnetic fluid hyperthermia for anti-tumor immune response.
      <br /><br />

      He is currently working on the detection of metabolic degradation in the mouse brain after rapid microwave fixation, the long term effect of neonatal hypoxia injury on brain metabolism by GlucoCEST MRI and 1H MR Spectroscopy with Dr. Tsang-Wei Tu, assistant professor at Howard University and Dr. Joseph Scafidi, neonatal neurologist at the Childrenâ€™s National Medical Center, Washington DC.`,
