    biography: `
        Dr. Tsang-Wei Tu is an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Howard University. His research interest is on the development of novel imaging methods for the detection of neurological diseases. Dr. Tu applies a multi-disciplinary approach, combining imaging technologies with trauma biomechanics, immunohistochemistry, behavior, and molecular and cellular analysis to establish potential imaging matrices for neurological diseases, including neonatal hypoxia and traumatic brain injury. Dr. Tuâ€™s research bridges radiological findings to the underlying pathophysiology to help identification of therapeutic effects in the brain.
        <br /><br />

        Dr. Tu graduated from National Cheng Kung University in 2000 with a BS and MS degree in Hydraulic Engineering. He received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Washington University in 2011 and completed postdoctoral training in the Radiology and Imaging Sciences at the NIH Clinical Center in 2016. Dr. Tu is the recipient of Young Investigator Award from the Missouri Spinal Cord Injury Research Program. His work on imaging metabolic depression after traumatic brain injury using CEST MRI was awarded research highlights in the WMIC in 2015 and 2017, and the Summa Cum Laude in the ISMRM in 2016. Dr. Tu received funding from the NIH and NSF.`,
