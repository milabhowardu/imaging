    biography: `
    Dr. Be-Ming Chang is a Post-doctoral fellow in the Molecular Imaging Laboratory of the Department of Radiology at Howard University. She holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the National Tsing-Hua University and a Ph.D. in Molecular Science and Technology from the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
    <br /><br />
    Dr. Chang has developed diverse hybrid materials that not only enable integrations of materials with multi-functionality but also expand their utilization in advanced applications. Her research combines expertise in chemistry, chemical structure design, nanotechnology, and polymer for biomedical, optical, electrical, and physical fields. She has comprehensive experience working collaboratively with interdisciplinary research teams, companies, and hospitals worldwide to develop essential products for scientific problem-solving and commercialization. Her research focuses on addressing materials for a wide range of techniques that can overcome key limitations and promote widespread adoption.
    <br /><br />
    Dr. Chang received awards, including the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award from BASF Corporation, the Outstanding Graduate Student Award from National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan, and selection honored as a doctoral student to 2014 Nobel Laureates Meeting in Japan.
