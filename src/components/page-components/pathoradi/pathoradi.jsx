          Radiological imaging is a critical part of healthcare services which
          physicians rely heavily upon in the medical decision-making process. A
          major goal of modern radiology and imaging sciences is to exploit
          specialized biophysical modeling that simulates the biological process
          in the living tissue to generate sensitive imaging contrast for
          disease detection. In order to understand the relations between the
          simulated image contrast and the underlying pathophysiology,
          radiologic-pathologic image analysis has to be performed to validate
          the image correlations in tissue structure, pathology and disease
          characteristics. Given the complex microenvironments in the tissues,
          comparison of radiologic and pathologic images is particularly
          challenging.

          Many of the routine analyses in the laboratories largely depend on
          manual or semi-automatic counting and segmentation of cells and
          tissues in the “gold standard” pathological images using commercially
          available software that are designed for general purposes. Researchers
          often have to give up an ample amount of information that shows in the
          pathological images but not quantifiable using the existing methods.
          This project aims to close the gap by utilizing deep learning
          methodology to extract the important features in the radiological and
          pathological images for quantitative analysis of the correlations
          previously unattainable in the community.

          To address the challenges that persist in comparing radiologic and
          pathologic images, the technical aims of the project are divided into

          The project outcome provides a novel deep learning methodology that
          can be used to standardize the benchmark evaluations in the
          development of radiological imaging biomarkers. The award enhances the
          graduate and undergraduate STEM education at the Howard University,
          with supports to a diverse and underrepresented cohort of the students
          in the biology and mathematics majors, through the use of cutting-edge
          artificial intelligence in the field of bioimaging research.
