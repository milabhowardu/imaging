      description: `Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a serious public health problem in the United States. Health disparities exist among African Americans with a 35% higher TBI incidence than Caucasians have, but they are less likely to have appropriate follow-up monitoring after emergency department discharge. Using a well-characterized rat model of diffuse TBI, this project investigates the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify the interrelations of trauma pathophysiology for diagnosis of diffuse TBI.`,

      Significance maps of the DTI-FA (A) and MTR (B) over a 30-days period following diffuse TBI. Decreases of DTI FA were most prominent in the major white matter tracts, suggesting superior specificity in detecting diffuse axonal injury. The changes of MTR at 3.5 ppm not only showed in the white matter tracts, but also in the gray matter regions, including cortex, striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus.`,
